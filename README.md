### Walmart Stock Data Analysis on Spark
- The code and project for Walmart data analysis can be found 

# Spark
Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. Designed for large-scale data processing, it run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk. Spark can run on Hadoop, Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources including HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, and S3. Spark has an advanced DAG execution engine that supports acyclic data flow and in-memory computing. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.

## About
This repository contains the projects and exercises done by me using Spark on Python. I have done some analysis on walmart data based on year 2012-2017
I have done analysis using both sparkSQL and dataframes. All the code should be executable as long as the computer meets the requirements mentioned in the dependencies section.

## Dependencies
I have worked on pycharm in windows but it can also be done on linux based system like ubuntu or cloudera quickstart etc.
To execute my projects you will need a system that satisfies below dependencies.
- Python 3.7
- Spark 3.3.2
- Java 8
